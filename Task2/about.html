        <p>Hi! I am Rohan Alwal, an enthusiastic Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student currently pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s degree at Walchand Institute of technology, Solapur. Prior to this, I earned a diploma in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from Government Polytechnic Solapur, which laid a strong foundation in software development and problem-solving.

          I am deeply passionate about technology and have hands-on experience in crafting innovative projects. My coding expertise spans Java, C++, and web development. Alongside my academic journey, I am gaining valuable industry exposure through an internship, enhancing both my technical proficiency and teamwork abilities.
